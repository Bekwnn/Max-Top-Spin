# Max-Top-Spin
A networked party game made with Unreal Engine 4

An non-traditional fighting game for 2-4 players. Full game planned to have online game lobby creation, multiple character types, and multiple maps. Gameplay is twitch-based frantic fun with snappy controls that feel satisfying to use.
